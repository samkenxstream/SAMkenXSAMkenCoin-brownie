    # The Go version to download (if necessary) and use. Supports semver spec and ranges.

    go-version: # optional

    # Path to the go.mod or go.work file.

    go-version-file: # optional

    # Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec

    check-latest: # optional

    # Used to pull node distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.

    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}

    # Used to specify whether caching is needed. Set to true, if you'd like to enable caching.

    cache: # optional, default is true

    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file - go.sum

    cache-dependency-path: # optional

    # Target architecture for Go to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
